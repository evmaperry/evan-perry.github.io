/**
 * FUNCTIONS
 * 
 * 1) Two phases of function construction: declaration and call/execute
 * 
 * 2) What's the difference between a function's parameters and arguments Passed
 *    to a function
 * 
 * 3) What the syntax for a named function
 * 
 * 4) How do we assign a function to a variable
 * 
 * 5) Functions can optionally take inputs, and optionally return a single value.
 *    How do we specify inputs, and how do we specifty outputs.
 * 
 * 6) Scope: functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes.
 *    The inverse is NOT true.
 * 
 * 7) Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house.
 *    If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory somewhere
 *    (ie, referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data continue to exist
 *    in these closures.
